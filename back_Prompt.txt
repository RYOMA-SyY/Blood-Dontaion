1. Backend Framework (Free Options)
Choose a backend language/framework:
Node.js (Express.js): Easy to set up, lots of free resources.
Python (Flask or Django): Django is more “batteries-included” (auth, admin, ORM), Flask is lightweight.
PHP (Laravel): Good for rapid development, but requires PHP hosting.
Java (Spring Boot): Powerful, but heavier to set up.
Recommendation: For simplicity and popularity, use Node.js with Express or Python with Flask.

2. Database (Free Options)
Relational Database:
PostgreSQL or MySQL/MariaDB (both free, open-source, widely supported)
NoSQL Option:
MongoDB Community Edition (document-based, easy to use with Node.js)
For local development/testing:
SQLite (file-based, zero setup, great for prototyping)
Recommendation:

Use PostgreSQL for structured data (users, donations, leaderboards).
Use SQLite for quick prototyping.
3. Core Backend Features to Implement
a. User Authentication
Register, login, logout
Password hashing (never store plain passwords)
Session or JWT-based authentication
b. User Profile Management
Store and update user info (name, email, blood type, donation stats, etc.)
c. Donation Tracking
Record each donation (user, date, amount/volume, etc.)
Calculate stats for leaderboards
d. Leaderboard Logic
Aggregate user stats (total donations, points, etc.)
Return sorted leaderboard data to frontend
e. APIs for Frontend
RESTful API endpoints for:
User registration/login
Fetch/update user profile
Submit new donation
Fetch leaderboard and statistics
4. Free Hosting/Deployment
Backend:
Render (free tier for web services)
Railway (free tier)
Fly.io (free tier)
Vercel/Netlify (for serverless functions, but limited for backend)
Database:
Free PostgreSQL on Supabase or Neon
Free MongoDB on MongoDB Atlas
5. Example Database Schema (PostgreSQL)
users: id, name, email, password_hash, blood_type, donor_level, avatar_url, etc.
donations: id, user_id, date, volume, points_awarded, etc.
achievements: id, user_id, type, date_awarded, etc.
6. Free Tools & Best Practices
Use GitHub for version control.
Use Docker for local development (optional, but helpful).
Use free SSL via Let’s Encrypt if you deploy.
Use Postman or Insomnia for API testing.
7. Security
Always hash passwords (bcrypt, argon2, etc.).
Validate and sanitize all user input.
Use HTTPS in production.
8. How to Start
Pick a backend stack (Node.js/Express or Python/Flask).
Set up your database (PostgreSQL or SQLite for dev).
Design your API endpoints and database schema.
Implement authentication and user management.
Add donation tracking and leaderboard logic.
Deploy backend and database using free cloud services.
If you’d like, I can generate a starter backend project (Node.js/Express or Flask) with a basic schema and API endpoints for you. Just let me know your preferred stack!
